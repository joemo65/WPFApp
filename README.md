# WPFApp

This application is used as a proof of concept which allows a user to browse and import an .xml file. 
After loading the LoanType file, the application will then display to the user the contents of the file and allow the user to 
do crud operations. Once the user is satisfied with the changes, they can then export the changes.

1. Run the LoanType.UI project to get the WPF application running.
2. To test upload the LoanType.xml file located in the LoanType.UI directory.
